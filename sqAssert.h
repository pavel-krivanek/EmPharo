/*
 * Informative assert definitions that print expression and line number.

 * assert's expression is evaluated only if NDEBUG is not defined and printed

 *
 * asserta's expression is always evaluated but only printed if it is false and
 * NDEBUG is not defined. (asserta => assert always)
 *
 * assertf's message is printed along with its line number if NDEBUG is not
 * defined. (assertf => assert fail)
 *
 * assertl, assertal & assertfl take a line number as an argument.
